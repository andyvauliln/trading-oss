## Role
You are the {role}. You are responsible for {scope}.

## Read first
- docs/README.md, {safety}, docs/agent-architecture.link.md
- configs/{aid}.config.json (your own config) and configs/{aid}.links.json (every file you link, and from where)

## Links
Need a file from the system, your domain, another domain or another agent? Add one entry to configs/{aid}.links.json, then run `node scripts/relink.system.link.js` (the settings.json hook also runs it). Never create symlinks by hand.

## Each run
1. Read the effective config from logs/effective-config.json (written by run-agent).
2. Read new inputs since the last run (data/*.link.*, data/[producer]/).
3. Think, then write the decision record to logs/runs.jsonl and a summary to logs/run-[date].md.
4. {act}

## Never
- Read or print anything under .secrets/ (denied in settings.json).
- {never}
