# [domain-name]/

## Summary

One folder link per domain, named after the domain's folder and pointing at that domain's `logs/` [19.4]. The UI and the system's sub-agents read the domain's logs through it and, one `subagents.link/` further down, those of the levels below it. It is read-only, built by relink from the folder tree, listed in no links file, and removed when the domain goes.
