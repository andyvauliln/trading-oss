# docs/

## Summary

The system's docs, for people and for every agent. The three main docs come first: the vision, read first; the README, every part of the system with the path to its docs; and the rebuild prompt, the spec an AI rebuilds the system from. Next to them are the topic notes agents read while they work: overview, architecture, conventions, safety, data schemas, flows, metrics, glossary, roadmap and feature map, the runbooks in `how-to/`, the common knowledge in `common/` and the lists in `index/`. Each domain adds its own notes in its own `docs/`, such as the prediction-market domain's `trading-` notes, reached through `subagents.link/`. The project's records live in `apps/project-IDE/data/`.

## Keep in mind

- When anything changes (an owner message, an answer, a file), run it through the knowledge base agent so every doc stays current.
- When a lower level's docs change, check the docs above it, up to the system's, in the order vision, README, rebuild prompt.
