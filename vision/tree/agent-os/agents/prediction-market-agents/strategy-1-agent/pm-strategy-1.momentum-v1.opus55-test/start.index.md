# start.sh

## Summary

Starts the agent for one run. The scheduler calls it for the main-run job in the workers file, every 15 minutes in the example, and the owner can also run it by hand. Through `run-agent` it merges the config, writes `logs/effective-config.json` and starts Claude Code headless in the agent's own folder, with its own `.claude/` and links. Unlike the system's `start.sh`, it does not start the scheduler. How it ties in is proposed.
