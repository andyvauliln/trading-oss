# run-tests.system.link.js

## Summary

A read-only file link to the shared `run-tests` script [14.1]. Because it sits in `tests/agents/`, it runs only agent tests and reads this folder's `tests.config.json`: `node tests/agents/run-tests.system.link.js`, with `--id` for one test or `--schedule` to narrow the set. create-agent adds it and relink builds it, so a fix to the shared script reaches every agent at once.
