# [test-id].test.[js|py]

## Summary

One script test per file, named after its id, such as `t-scripts-001.test.js` or `.py`. It is a normal node or pytest file that checks one of the agent's own or linked scripts on fixture data. Each test has an entry in this folder's `tests.config.json`, and `run-tests` runs it from there. The format is proposed.

## Keep in mind

- When you write a script test, use fixture data only: no network and no secrets.
