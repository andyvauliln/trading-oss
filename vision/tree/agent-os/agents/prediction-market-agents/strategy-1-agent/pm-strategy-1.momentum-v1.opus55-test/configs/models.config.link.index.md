# models.config.link.json

## Summary

A read-only file link to the shared `models.config.json` [11.11], which routes every AI-using agent, sub-agent and worker to a platform and model. This variant's route is `opus-5.5` on Claude Code, matching the `opus55` in its name. A job's own `model` wins; `model: "route"` looks it up there (format proposed). Relink builds the link from the links file [27.3].

## Keep in mind

- When you want this agent on another model, create a new test variant with a new name; a route change is never made in place.
