# risk-check.decision.link.js

## Summary

A read-only file link to the domain's shared risk check `scripts/decisions/risk-check.decision.js` [14.3], so every trading agent of the domain uses one copy and gets every fix at once. The decision script [33] calls it before every order: both stop switches first, then the domain's global, per-agent and per-venue caps as tightened by the agent's config, and for live the allowlist and an owner-approved account. A failed check blocks the order and alerts the owner (proposed).

## Keep in mind

- When you want stricter limits for this agent, tighten `capital_and_risk` in its config; never copy or edit the shared check through this link.
