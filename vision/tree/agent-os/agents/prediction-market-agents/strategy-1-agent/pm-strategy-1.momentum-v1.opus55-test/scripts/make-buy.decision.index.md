# make-buy.decision.js

## Summary

The agent's only way to trade, called with one decision (market, action, size, price, probability, reason). It reads the mode from `effective-config.json`, test unless live-allowed, and calls the domain's risk check [30.1]: both stop switches first (the general one and the domain's order switch), then the risk caps; a failed check blocks the order. In test it records a simulated fill, in live a real order (proposed; no executor yet). Open: whether code, the model or both decide.

## Keep in mind

- When you change this script, keep both stop switches and the risk check in code before every order, in test and in live.
- When you give this script venue keys, take them from `load-secret` through `secret_keys`, never from code or the prompt.
