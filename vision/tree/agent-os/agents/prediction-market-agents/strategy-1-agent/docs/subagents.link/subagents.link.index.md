# subagents.link/

## Summary

The strategy's child links for docs: one folder link per trading variant, pointing at that variant's `docs/`. Through them the strategy session and its self-improvement sub-agent read each variant's docs, above all its `changes.md`, which says exactly what the variant changes against its parent and what is being tested. `relink` builds the entries from the folder tree and removes them when a variant is deleted; they are read-only and never followed recursively.
