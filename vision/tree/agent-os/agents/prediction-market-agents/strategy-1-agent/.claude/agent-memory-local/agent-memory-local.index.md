# agent-memory-local/

## Summary

Machine-local memory for strategy sub-agents that use `memory: local`. It is git-ignored local tool state, so its content stays on the machine that wrote it. No strategy sub-agent uses it yet.

## Keep in mind

- When you need memory that survives a fresh clone or is shared, use `agent-memory/` instead.
