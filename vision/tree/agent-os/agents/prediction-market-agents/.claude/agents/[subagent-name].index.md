# [subagent-name].md

## Summary

The pattern for one domain-level sub-agent: a Markdown file named after it, with its own context and tools. Proposed names follow `pm-[role]-agent` (no scope at domain level) and must be unique. Proposed frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `tools` and `memory`; the model comes from the routing config, not from the file. Only the self-improvement sub-agent is named so far.

## Keep in mind

- When you add a sub-agent, check its name is free in the registry and the sub-agent index.
- When you choose its model, set it in `models.config.json`, not in this file.
