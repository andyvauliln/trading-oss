# settings.local.json

## Summary

Personal, machine-local overrides of the domain's Claude Code settings, such as `model` or `env.LOG_LEVEL`. It is git-ignored and never needed for the domain agent to run.

## Keep in mind

- When you need a setting for the domain agent to run, such as the live-secrets deny rule or the relink hook, put it in `settings.json`, not here.
