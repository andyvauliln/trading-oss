# start.sh

## Summary

Starts one domain session in the domain folder, so it loads only the domain's `.claude/` and links and reads its strategies through `subagents.link/`. The scheduler calls it for the domain session job in the domain's workers file (every 4 hours in the example), and the owner can also run it by hand. How it ties into the scheduler is proposed.
