# stop-trading-agent.md

## Summary

The runbook for stopping a trading agent, the trading steps added to the system's `how-to/stop-or-delete-agent.md`: for a live agent, close or flatten its open positions and have the owner set its account back to unfunded; for a variant retired by the strategy loop, record why in the strategy's research item and history. Whether a self-improvement sub-agent may retire variants on its own is still open. The steps are proposed.

## Keep in mind

- When you stop a live trading agent, check it has no open positions left.
