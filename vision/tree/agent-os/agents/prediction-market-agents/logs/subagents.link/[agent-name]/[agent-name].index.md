# [agent-name]/

## Summary

One folder link per strategy, named after the strategy's folder (for example `strategy-1-agent/`), pointing at that strategy's `logs/`. Through it the domain reads the strategy's logs without copies, and reaches its variants' `logs/` one `subagents.link/` further down. Relink builds and removes it from the folder tree; it is read-only and never listed in a links file.

## Keep in mind

- When you need a strategy's files changed, leave it to the strategy; the domain writes only its own files.
