# jobs/[job-id]/

## Summary

The run logs of the domain's own jobs, one folder per job (for example `polymarket-prices` and `markets-catalog`): `history.jsonl` with one line per run and `latest.log` with the output of the last run, written by `run-job`. A trading agent links a worker's `latest.log` when it needs to see if its data is fresh.
